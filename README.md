# Marketing data
 A Microsoft Power BI report on the effectiveness of marketing and customer data. In this README file, you can read about the report and see some screenshots, but you can also download the report above to click through the report yourself.
 
 This report has been made with sample data from [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis).
 
 The report is made with Microsoft Power BI. It features interactive visuals, DAX measures, and a intuitive filter panel.

 On the main page, you can get a filter panel by clicking on the arrow on the left of the screen. From here, you can filter out certain demographics, and see anomalies in age/income and filter those out as well. This is very important for analytics.

 For both Age and Educaiton, I have made a page int he report where the user can get more info on spending habits of customers per age group or education. The age groups are dynamically made with DAX, so these will change as the data changes.

For many businesses, it is crucial to know when new customers sign up, and when the customers sign up who spend the most money. This page will tell them just that.
